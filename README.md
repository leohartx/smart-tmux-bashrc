# smart-tmux-bashrc
For the better tmux work flow on all environments !!.
i have created a script that make default terminal to collaborate with tmux. With this script installed, the following things will happen when you open your terminal window.

* it will create new tmux session automatically.
* re-attach to the only tmux session.
* offer you option to select  existing sessions if there is more than 1 tmux session.
* it also offer option to create new tmux session with custom name.


# Tutorial
1. download smart-tmux.sh
2. make it executable with : chmod +x smart-tmux.sh
3. run it with : ./smart-tmux.sh
4. when you understand how it works, it's time to include smart-tmux.sh content to the end of your .bashrc file and enjoy better terminal experience with smart tmux init script.
